**Abstract:**

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently gained a significant interest in the research community owing to their unrivaled commercial chances in wireless communications, search 
and rescue, surveillance, logistics, delivery, and intelligent agriculture. In safety critical applications such as intrusions, identifying the type of drone enhances the countermeasures.
This paper proposes classifying UAVs from radio frequency (RF) fingerprints using time-frequency transformation and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed methodology 
involves RF fingerprints’ wavelet synchrosqueezed transform (WSST) followed by a proposed lightweight CNN model. The methodology is verified on a data set containing fifteen 
different classes of drone’s RF fingerprint. The proposed CNN model size, Raspberry Pi deployment feasibility, and accuracy are compared with the existing pre-trained state-of-art 
deep learning models. The proposed model achieves a testing accuracy of 99.09% at 387 kilobytes (KB) size and can run on Raspberry Pi in 25.54 milliseconds.
